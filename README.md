# TryHackMe – Blue Team Labs

This repository documents my progress and key takeaways from the Blue Team Pathway on TryHackMe, a hands-on cybersecurity training platform. These labs simulate real-world SOC workflows, helping me develop critical skills in threat detection, log analysis, and incident response.

## 🔍 Key Focus Areas

- **Log Analysis**: Investigated logs from Linux/Windows systems to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Phishing Triage**: Analyzed suspicious email headers and attachments to determine legitimacy.
- **SIEM Concepts**: Practiced event correlation and alert triage using Splunk-style workflows.
- **Network Forensics**: Used Wireshark and other tools to inspect network traffic for threats.
- **Incident Response**: Simulated detection-to-remediation flows, including report writing and escalation procedures.
